The simulation can be started by running the quadcopter_script in the respective folder for each question. Once the simulation
has started, the "move command" can be sent to the quadcopter by pressing the green "Move!" button. The button is disabled 
during action so that the quadcopter can complete the specific behaviour, e.g. moving to a height of 2.5m or moving around 
a circle, before being able to received the next "move command" for the next action (to prevent unstability). For 5c and 5d
(in the respective folders), the magnitude of the noise and wind can be tuned by changing the noise magnitude in the "sense" 
function of the Drone file and u_20 value in the wind.mlx file. Keep in mind the simulation may fail to run because of inappropriate values.
And, the "move!" button should be clicked as soon as possible after the drone moved to a height of 2.5m for 5c and 5d, otherwise
the drone would swift away to another position leading to instability.
