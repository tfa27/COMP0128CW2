The simulation can be started by running the quadcopter_script in the respective folder for each question. Once the simulation has started, the "move command" can be
sent to the quadcopter by pressing the green "Move!" button. The button is disabled during action so that the quadcopter can 
complete the specific behaviour, e.g. moving to a height of 2.5m or moving around a circle, before being able to received the
next "move command" for the next action (to prevent unstability). For 5c and 5d (in the respective folders), the magnitude of 
the noise and wind can be tuned by changing the noise magnitude in the "sense" function of the Drone file and u_20 value in 
the wind.mlx file. Keep in mind the simulation may fail to run because of inappropriate values.
